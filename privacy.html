    <p>At File Tools Suite, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>File Processing</h2>
    <p>Most tools run entirely on your device, meaning your files never leave your browser. If server-side processing is needed for heavy conversions, files are stored temporarily and deleted automatically.</p>

    <h2>Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information. Any data entered in forms (such as contact messages) is only used for support purposes.</p>

    <h2>Cookies & Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may use cookies for analytics and improving user experience. Third-party advertisers like Google AdSense may also place cookies for ad personalization.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, modify, or request deletion of your data by contacting us at <b>support@filetoolsuite.com</b>.</p>
