    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We built File Tools Suite to provide free, fast, and secure online utilities for everyone. Our goal is to make everyday file conversions and web tools accessible without installing heavy apps.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Our tools are powered by modern web APIs such as PDF-lib, JSZip, Canvas, and more. Most processing happens directly in your browser for privacy and speed. Some heavy conversions may use temporary server support.</p>

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>We are continuously improving the platform. Upcoming features include advanced PDF editing, OCR support, office file conversions, and optional user accounts for personalization.</p>
